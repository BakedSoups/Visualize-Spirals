## About this Project
there are many scratch projects that utilize this patern 
this partern being a que of the patern up right down left with a certain distance (10 up ,20 right ,30 down ,40 left ,50 up)
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1284047/ 

However they are very limited in terms of the amount of movements you can take and in terms of efficiency so I scaled it up with matplotlib and python3 

## To run on you system
1. Clone the repo
2. pip install pyautogui tkinter pillow 
3. python main.py
