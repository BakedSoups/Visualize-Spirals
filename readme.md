## About this Project
there is pattern where you set a que of odd numbers to repersent the distance they would travel in a certain direction the go up right down left(10 up ,20 right ,30 down ,40 left ,50 up)

there are scratch projects that visualize this: 
[[https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1284047/ ](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/101663630/)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/101663630/)
 
However they are very limited in terms of the amount of movements you can take and in terms of efficiency so I scaled it up with matplotlib and python3 

with this you can visualise some pretty cool spirals
